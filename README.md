## Description

The project I made is a watch e-commerce web application. In the project, I created an account system and dashboard where users can manage their accounts. I made a basket system and an ordering system for shopping. I created many features in the project, such as a review system and wishlist.
<br>
In the project, I used Python's Django framework in the backend and Jquery in the frontend.
